Worldviews are born as life’s situations and circumstances unfold. However, once these conceptions are formed, they acquire the solidity of a rock, adapting at certain points but always maintaining the inherent soundness of their construction.

# Our worldview

In our current worldview, we are living through an arms race triggered by the inability of state actors to achieve their economic, commercial, and political objectives through dialogue and diplomacy. This intensifies, within the inherently anarchic international system, the pursuit of foreign policies focused on deterrence through armament. Considering peace as the absence of conflict, conflict itself becomes a matter of time, eventually leading nations and peoples into direct or indirect military confrontation.

From a geopolitical standpoint, Brazil requires tools to deter other nations, following its traditional diplomatic approach, from causing tensions in the international system that could lead to military confrontation. Therefore, restoring military capabilities, including the development of the military-industrial complex, becomes fundamental.

# Acting in the national interest

To fill a gap in the existing market for military components and to promote deterrence so that other nations do not become adversaries, the use of artificial intelligence becomes indispensable for developing solutions to be applied in facility security, the protection of civilians and military personnel, and, above all, in the pursuit of peace through deterrence.

Therefore, the purpose of Urbano Sheepdog is not only to build hardware devices for use in rural areas or for perimeter control of sensitive governmental or military installations. It is to develop technical capabilities, hardware, and technology capable of fostering the Brazilian military-industrial complex to achieve peace through the deterrence of other nations, protecting civilians with security devices, assisting the Armed Forces in the conception of new technologies, and providing governments — Municipal, State, and Federal — with means to deter both external and internal enemies, whether in combating common crime or external threats.

We want to be ready to assist, supply, and develop, as a way to seek peace through deterrence, maintaining our sovereignty and honoring the defense of our Brazilian People.
